# TypeQuest — A Safe and Private Typing Game

TypeQuest is an offline**, privacy-first fun typing game that encourages people to build upon their speed and accuracy without monitoring, collecting, or transfering any of their personal data.

## Why TypeQuest?
Many online typing sites collect usage data. TypeQuest runs all on your computer with no telemetry and all data is stored on your computer.

## Core Features
- Random word prompts from a locally installed list
- Timed rounds
- Local scoring: Words Per Minute (WPM) and Accuracy (%)
- Private progress history stored on computer (JSON)

## Roadmap

## Sprint 1 (this week)
- [X] Add this ROADMAP with checkboxes — Connor
- [X] Find one similar typing project on GitHub and save the link — Connor
- [ ] Fork/clone that project into the org as `typequest-reference` — Connor
- [ ] Add a very small Python file (`app.py`) that runs — Connor
- [X] Write 3 lines in README on how to run it — Connor

## Sprint 2 (next two weeks)
- [ ] Timer (like 60 seconds)
- [ ] Show words-per-minute (WPM)
- [ ] Show accuracy (% correct)
- [ ] Save results to a file (JSON/CSV)

**How to run (basic):**
- You will have a file called `app.py`.
- You can open that file or run it with Python (`python app.py`).
- Follow the instructions on the screen.
